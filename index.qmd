# Introduction {.unnumbered}

These notes are intended to accompany the the Digital Life Sience Data Lab course. Nils will work with you through these examples in a workshop format. This means he will live code and you will accompany him. We specifically do *not* want to give you these codes up front, since writing your own code and making mistakes is the best way to learn.
